I've done Java programming before, but it has been a while. I've primarily used Python for the last year on my personal projects, so I'd like to do some practice so that I can achieve an easy 4.0 in the class.
## Projects
When I sat in on Professor Kirlin's 241 during my visit to Rhodes, I saved the github.io site that he had the syllabus and projects on. I managed to find one of the same format for last falls 142 [here](https://pkirlin.github.io/cs142-f22/). \
Since I have access to them, there's no better practice than what I'll actually be doing during the class. I do still fully intend on completing these again during the class, seeing what I've learned and how I can improve.
